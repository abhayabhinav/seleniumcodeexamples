Git hub Command line

git clone <past the link> - one time when syncing up the project on local folder

First Guy:-

Change Directory, go to path where the project is and type - 
1. git status - gives the status on untracked file
2. git add <name> - add your new/modified project or for all user "."
3. get status - Untracked file goes away, but it is not yet commmitted to the your local git repository	
4. git commit -m "message" (adds file to your local repository , -m stands for the message under quotes). File will be added locally , but not synced to the git server
5. git push - pushes the commited changes to the server
--------------------------------after the work performed by the second guy------------------------------
6. git pull

Second Guy Working:-

1. git pull - This will get the filed added by the the first guy to his local repository. If I make a change in this new file just pulled and save in local and.....
2. git status - untracked files (ones which I pulled and modified, andothers which I have not added yet to the server)
3. git add ./git add - A - 
4. git commit - m "message"
5. git push 

------To check all the git commands , just type git - It will list all the commands-------

Workflow :-

1. Start the day by doing a git pull
2. commit every few hours, if there are changes
3. Do Push every few hours if there are commits
4. Do Pull every few hours

Tips:-
In case you missed to add message while commit , it will throw an error, where in you will now type your message and then hot esc and type :wq and hit  Enter

Merger Conflict:- 
Manually handle it
